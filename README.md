# rawsql
A rust library for *using* and *reusing* SQL.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/manute/rawsql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/manute/rawsql) [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rawsql.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rawsql)

*is heavily influenced by [yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql) (many thanks @krisajenkins)*

### [DOC](http://manute.github.io/rawsql/rawsql/index.html) ###

You can integrate rawsql into your project through the [releases on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rawsql):
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
rawsql = "0.1.1"
```

## Overview
You need to write SQL and you need to reuse it. You don't want to duplicate the queries all over the code. This lib is for you.

*This lib does not execute any sql in the DB.*

## Usage
The basic idea is to separate the sql part from the code and put it into its own sql files. With this approach, you gain sql powers and the ability to write sql only once that runs on your DB (your dba could modify these files too)

The sql file needs to be with this format :

```sql
-- name: insert-person
INSERT INTO "person" (name, data) VALUES ($1, $2);

-- name: select-persons
SELECT id, name, data FROM person;

```

> comment with the  **-- name: ** , it will be the key value for getting each query.

> the ";" will be needed at the end of the query.


```rust

extern crate rawsql;

use rawsql::Loader;


fn main() {

    let queries = Loader::get_queries_from("examples/postgre.sql").unwrap().queries;

    //Insert query
    let qinsert = queries.get("insert-person").unwrap();

    println!("{}", qinsert);

    //Select query
    let qselect = queries.get("select-persons").unwrap();
    println!("{}", qselect);

}

```

### Why not execute SQL this lib?
In rust there is not yet a general driver like *JDBC* or go's *database/sql* so I decide to abstract first the parser of sql files to use directly with the libs already exists for each DB.
